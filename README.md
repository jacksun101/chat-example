# chat-example

This is the source code for a very simple chat example used for 
the [Getting Started](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/) guide 
of the Socket.IO website.

Please refer to it to learn how to run this application.

And by the reference here, now we can run this chat example with node cluster.
